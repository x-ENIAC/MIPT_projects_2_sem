Here the task was to speed up the rendering of the Mandelbrot set. This was done using SSE optimizations. An accelerated version can be found in the fast_version folder. This optimization significantly speeds up the recalculation of the set.

The image can be moved with the keys up, down, right, left. You can also scale the picture using the A and Z keys. Please note that the more black areas in the picture, the slower it will be drawn.

Try to get as close to the image as possible! It's bewitching.

Below you can see examples of some parts of the set.
